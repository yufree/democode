STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS393"
Study Title	"Metabolomic analysis of riboswitch containing E. coli recombinant expression system"
Study Description	"In this study we have employed metabolomics approaches to understand the metabolic effects of producing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli cells. This metabolic burden analysis was performed against a number of recombinant expression systems and control strains and included: (i) standard transcriptional recombinant expression control system BL21(DE3) with the expression plasmid pET-eGFP, (ii) the recently developed dual transcriptional–translational recombinant expression control strain BL21(IL3), with pET-eGFP, (iii) BL21(DE3) with an empty expression plasmid pET, (iv) BL21(IL3) with an empty expression plasmid, and (v) BL21(DE3) without an expression plasmid; all strains were cultured under various induction conditions. The growth profiles of all strains together with the results gathered by the analysis of the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy data, identified IPTG-dependent induction as the dominant factor hampering cellular growth and metabolism, which was in general agreement with the findings of GC-MS analysis of cell extracts and media samples. In addition, the exposure of host cells to the synthetic inducer ligand, pyrimido[4,5-d] pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (PPDA), of the orthogonal riboswitch containing expression system (BL21(IL3)) did not display any detrimental effects, and its detected levels in all the samples were at similar levels, emphasising the inability of the cells to metabolise PPDA. The overall results obtained in this study suggested that although the BL21(DE3)-EGFP and BL21(IL3)-EGFP strains produced comparable levels of recombinant eGFP, the presence of the orthogonal riboswitch seemed to be moderating the metabolic burden of eGFP production in the cells enabling higher biomass yield, whilst providing a greater level of control over protein expression."

Study Protocol Description	"The E. coli BL21 DE3 strain not harbouring the pET15b plasmid was used as a control strain and referred to as wild type. All remaining E. coli strains carried the pET15b plasmid with the lac operator driving the expression of the plasmid downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The pET and EGFP strains carried the T7 RNA polymerase gene in their genome under the control of the lac promoter/operator. The IL3-pET and IL3-EGFP strains also carried a genomic copy of the T7 RNA polymerase; however its expression is further regulated by an orthogonal riboswitch downstream of the lac promoter/operator region.33 Both EGFP and IL3-EGFP strains carried the eGFP coding gene on their recombinant plasmids. The riboswitch construct is described in more detail in the ESI. See Table 1 in the paper associated with this study to see the full list of strains used.
</p>
50 ml of LB broth, 3 biological replicates per condition, was inoculated with the appropriate strains using the overnight grown cells to a final OD600nm = 0.1, followed by incubation at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking, in a Multitron standard shaker incubator (INFORS-HT Bottmingen Switzerland), for 3 hr. Upon reaching the OD600nm = 0.5 the samples were exposed to one of the inducing conditions (see Table 2 in the paper associated with this study), and the incubation temperature was decreased to 20 °C with 200 rpm for 8 hr in shaking incubators, which sums up to a total of 11 hr of incubation. 15 ml samples from each flask were quenched using 30 ml, 60% aqueous methanol (-48 °C) following procedures described in previous studies[1].

Briefly, the biomass pellets were suspended in 500 µl of 100% methanol (-48 °C), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and allowed to thaw on dry ice. The freeze-thaw cycle was performed 3 times in order to permeabilize the cells, resulting in the leakage of the metabolites from the cells. The suspensions were centrifuged at 15,871 x g, at -9 °C, for 5 min. The supernatant was retained and stored on dry ice, and a further aliquot (500 µl) of 100% methanol (-48 °C) was added to the pellet. The above procedure was repeated, and the second aliquot of methanol was combined with the first. The sample was stored on dry ice for further analysis.
</p>
All extracts were normalized according to OD600nm followed by combining 100 µl from each of the samples in a new tube, to be used as the quality control (QC) sample. 100 µl internal standard solution (0.2 mg/ml succinic-d4 acid, 0.2 mg/ml glycine-d5, 0.2 mg/ml benzoic-d5 acid, and 0.2 mg/ml lysine-d4) was added to all the samples (including QCs) followed by an overnight drying step using a speed vacuum concentrator (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, Cambridge, UK).
</p>
Derivatization was carried out by oximation (using methoxyamine-hydrochloride in pyridine) followed by a silylation step (using N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide), as previously described[2][3].

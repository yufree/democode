% You might find the 'draft' option to a0 poster useful if you have
% lots of graphics, because they can take some time to process and
% display. (\documentclass[a0,draft]{a0poster})

% Switch off page numbers on a poster, obviously, and section numbers too.
\pagestyle{empty}

% The textpos package is necessary to position textblocks at arbitary 
% places on the page.

% Graphics to include graphics. Times is nice on posters, but you
% might want to switch it off and go for CMR fonts.

% These colours are tried and tested for titles and headers. Don't
% over use color!

% Set up the grid
%
% Note that [40mm,40mm] is the margin round the edge of the page --
% it is _not_ the grid size. That is always defined as 
% PAGE_WIDTH/HGRID and PAGE_HEIGHT/VGRID. In this case we use
% 15 x 25. This gives us a wide central column for text (7 grid
% spacings) and two narrow columns (3 each) at each side for 
% pictures, separated by 1 grid spacing.
%
% Note however that texblocks can be positioned fractionally as well,
% so really any convenient grid size can be used.

% Understanding textblocks is the key to being able to do a poster in
% LaTeX. In
%
%    \begin{textblock}{wid}(x,y)
%    ...
%    \end{textblock}
%
% the first argument gives the block width in units of the grid
% cells specified above in \TPGrid; the second gives the (x,y)
% position on the grid, with the y axis pointing down.

% You will have to do a lot of previewing to get everything in the 
% right place.

% This gives good title positioning for a portrait poster.
% Watch out for hyphenation in titles - LaTeX will do it
% but it looks awful.
